## 2) Overview and Key Features

The app combines voice recognition, image analysis, and text processing to provide intelligent medical triage decisions. Using on-device ML (TensorFlow Lite), it classifies likely conditions, computes urgency, and suggests recommended actions.

- Voice-to-Text: Capture symptoms via Android SpeechRecognizer
- Image Classification: AI-powered skin condition detection using a CNN
- Text Classification: Estimate severity from typed/dictated symptoms
- Multimodal Fusion: Weighted fusion of image + text predictions
- Urgency Flags: Green / Yellow / Red
- Disease Precautions: Maps conditions to recommended actions
- Telehealth Integration: Hooks to call/connect to care
- Offline-First: All ML inference on-device (privacy-friendly)

Why it runs well on-device:
- Mobile-friendly TFLite models; quantization enabled where possible
- Efficient pre/post-processing for low latency
- Graceful fallbacks: app remains usable even if models are missing

---

## 3) App Interface (Workflow)

1. Launch the app and grant Camera/Microphone permissions
2. Optional: capture or select a skin image
3. Press ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù to dictate symptoms; press ‚ÄúStop‚Äù when done
4. Tap ‚ÄúAnalyze‚Äù to run multimodal inference
5. Review urgency flag, predicted condition(s), confidence, and precautions
6. Use telehealth shortcuts if the case is urgent

The app displays a small banner if ML assets are missing, and uses rule-based fallback logic so you can still test end-to-end flows.

## 5) Getting Started (Android)

Prerequisites
- Android Studio (Giraffe/Flamingo or newer)
- JDK 17 (project targets Java/Kotlin 17)

Steps (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# Clone and open in Android Studio
git clone https://github.com/Arjjun-S/EmergencyTriageApp.git
cd EmergencyTriageApp

# Open the folder in Android Studio and let Gradle sync
# Run on a device/emulator (Android 8.0 / API 26+ recommended)
```

---

## 6) ML Assets Placement

Place these files in `app/src/main/assets/models/`:

- Image model: `rash_model.tflite`, `rash_model_labels.txt`
- Text model: `text_classifier.tflite`, `text_classifier_labels.txt`, `vocab.txt`
- Optional data: `DiseasePrecaution.csv`

Final asset layout:

```
app/src/main/assets/models/
  rash_model.tflite
  rash_model_labels.txt
  text_classifier.tflite
  text_classifier_labels.txt
  vocab.txt
  DiseasePrecaution.csv
```

If any assets are missing, the app still runs with safe fallbacks.

---

## 7) Datasets and Data Preparation

1) Image dataset (skin/rash):

- Recommended Keras directory layout:
  ```
  datasets/SkinDisease/
    train/
      Acne/ ...jpg
      Eczema/ ...jpg
      ...
    test/  (optional)
  ```
- Use public datasets (e.g., HAM10000, ISIC) where licenses permit.
- Keep classes balanced and remove any personal identifiers/EXIF.

2) Symptoms dataset (text):

- Use `datasets/DiseaseAndSymptoms.csv` with `Symptom_1..Symptom_n` columns.
- Optional `Severity` column; if missing, the training script infers labels from keywords.

---

## 8) Training and Converting Models

Environment setup (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv ; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Train and convert image model:

```powershell
python .\ml\train_image_model.py
python .\ml\convert_image_to_tflite.py
```

Train and convert text model:

```powershell
python .\ml\train_text_model.py
python .\ml\convert_text_to_tflite.py
```

Notes
- For a lighter text model suitable for mobile, set `model_type` to `simple_nn` or `lstm` in `train_text_model.py`.
- The converters already enable quantization to reduce model size.

---

## 9) AI/ML Pipeline and How It Works

Image Classification (Skin Disease)
- Architecture: EfficientNetB0 base + custom dense head
- Input: 224√ó224 RGB images
- Output: class probabilities for skin conditions

Text Classification (Symptom Severity)
- Options: simple NN, LSTM, or DistilBERT
- Input: tokenized symptom descriptions (max ~128 tokens)
- Output: severity/condition probabilities

Multimodal Fusion
- Fusion: weighted average (default Image 0.7, Text 0.3)
- Urgency logic: conservative mapping to Green/Yellow/Red with precautions

On-Device Inference
- Entire inference pipeline runs via TFLite; telehealth is optional.

Expected (with full datasets; indicative)
- Image: ~85‚Äì92% accuracy
- Text: ~88‚Äì95% accuracy

---

## 10) Configuration (Android + ML)

Android app
- Min SDK: 26 (Android 8.0) or as configured in `build.gradle`
- Target SDK: 34

Training defaults

- Batch size: 32
- Epochs: 50‚Äì100

---

## 11) Performance and Optimizations

- Quantize models (float16/int8) for better speed/size
- Use NNAPI or GPU delegate if available on device
- Keep input images clear, centered, and well-lit to improve accuracy
- Ensure label order matches between training and mobile

---

## 12) Troubleshooting

| Issue | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| ‚ÄúModels missing‚Äù banner | Confirm files under `app/src/main/assets/models/` |
| Build errors | Let Gradle sync; Build > Clean Project; restart Android Studio |
| Poor image results | Improve lighting/quality, expand training data |
| Speech not captured | Check microphone permission; try in quiet area |
